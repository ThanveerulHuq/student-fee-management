- `error_type` - Error classification
- `action` - Performance action type

## Data Protection Guarantees

### ‚úÖ What We Track
- User engagement patterns and feature adoption
- Most popular sections and workflows

- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Financial transaction details

## Privacy & Security Best Practices

1. **üîí Privacy First**: Never track PII, financial data, or sensitive information
2. **üìä Engagement Focus**: Track user interactions and system usage patterns only
3. **üéØ Business Intelligence**: Focus on feature usage and user journey insights
4. **üîç Testing**: Verify no sensitive data is sent using GA4 Real-time reports
5. **üìù Documentation**: Keep this file updated with any new engagement events
6. **üè∑Ô∏è Consistency**: Use consistent naming for events and categories

## Monitoring

Monitor analytics data in:
- Google Analytics 4 Dashboard
- Real-time reports for testing
- Conversion events for key business metrics
- Custom reports for specific insights

## Environment Configuration

Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` is set in your environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

## Compliance

This analytics implementation is designed to comply with:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- Student privacy laws and regulations
- Educational data protection standards
- Local data protection requirements

## Future Considerations

1. Complete remaining student management event tracking
2. Add comprehensive administrative action tracking
3. Implement performance monitoring
4. Add custom dimensions for better segmentation
5. Create GA4 custom reports for school-specific metrics
